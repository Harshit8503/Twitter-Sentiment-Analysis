# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
The objective of the project was to predict different Sentiments i.e. Positive,Negative,Neutral of the tweets. Initially, tweets are processed 
as text data and undergo preprocessing steps like tokenization and removing stopwords. Next, features are extracted from the text using 
techniques such as word embeddings, which capture the underlying patterns in the language. These features are then fed into dense layers 
for sentiment classification, where the model learns to predict whether a tweet expresses a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.
Tech Stack Used: NumPy , Pandas , MatPlotlib ,Tensorflow, NLTK ,LSTM.
